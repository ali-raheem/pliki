# Delirium

Organic cerebral syndrome also referred to as an ‘acute confusional state’ and characterized by the presence of the following:

1. Impairment of consciousness and attention
2. Global disturbance of cognition
3. Psychomotor disturbance (HYPO OR HYPER-ACTIVE)
4. Disturbance of sleep-wake cycle
5. Emotional disturbance

Note: For definite diagnosis of delirium, symptoms of all of the above should be present *however mildly*. Delirium is common (20% hospital patients at some point during their admission).

## Common causes

infection (commonly chest or urine); fever; iatrogenic (particularly pain medication e.g.
opiates); dehydration; electrolyte disturbance; anaemia; drug or alcohol
withdrawal or intoxification; renal or hepatic illness; major surgery;
epilepsy; head injury or infection; terminal illness; constipation;
being in an unfamiliar place….

Delirium classically presents as *acute* in onset with *fluctuating*
course, *clouding of consciousness*, poor short term memory and
inattention (as opposed to *dementia* which is *insidious* in onset,
steadily *progressive* in course and *in clear consciousness* until
later stages).

## Delirium subtypes

* hyperactive (increased motor activity with agitation, hallucinations and
inappropriate behaviour)
* hypoactive (reduced motor activity and lethargy)
* mixed (features of hyper and hypoactive
delirium)?**

### Hyperactive delirium

With <span class="underline">HYPER</span>ACTIVE delirium, a patient can
become aggressive, violent and agitated with those around them. They may
hear things, can become paranoid, and they are overall confused.
Delusional thoughts are common. In these instances a delirium may be
confused with something like *schizophrenia*.

#### Hyperactive delirium symptoms

- **Waxing and waning—**it comes and goes
- **Issues with concentration**
- **Pulling out medical lines**
- **Yelling profanities**
- **Throwing things**
- **Agitated**
- **Responding to things in the room that aren’t there**
- **Not acting like themselves**

### Hypoactive delirium

Warning! **HYPOACTIVE** delirium is often missed

Because the presentation is much less dramatic compared to hyperactive
delirium. People with hypoactive delirium are confused and disoriented,
but they are NOT pulling out their lines, yelling, or physically
restless. In these instances, symptoms of hypoactive delirium may be
confused with *depression* or *cognitive decline*.

#### Hypoactive delirium symptoms

* Slower movement
* Softer speech
* Slower responses
* Withdrawn
* Not eating as much

In both schizophrenia and depression onset is distinct to delirium in
terms of onset and course which is *variable* (although note there is
diurnal variation in depression with low mood tending to be worse in the
early morning) with NO clouding of consciousness (although psychotic
patients can appear perplexed which should not be confused with this).
Psychotic symptoms where arising are COMPLEX and SUSTAINED in these
patients. This is in contrast to ‘psychotic’ symptoms in delirium which
are COMMON and tend to be SIMPLE and FLEETING.

## Screening for delirium

* Does the person know who they are?
* Does the person know where they are?
* In what detail does the person understand where they are?
* Does the person know the date?
* Can they orient to the situation? Do they know why they are there and the circumstances that led to them being in the hospital?
* Can they repeat back a few words? Ask them later if they remember the three words asked previously).
* Test for concentration: like asking the days of the week in reverse order.
* Assess visual and spatial ability e.g. ask them to draw a clock to look for spacing, impairments, or difficulties.
Some tests that are common to determine delirium are:
  - The Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)
  - The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)
  - 4AT

## Management

Warning! DELIRIUM IS A REVERSIBLE MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

**PREVENTION (from developing and from worsening) is the most effective
strategy for reducing frequency and complications.**

1.  **<span class="underline">Treat underlying medical or organic cause(s)</span> (if identifiable)**
2.  **Minimize contributing factors**
3.  **Review medication list for precipitants (opioids, antihistamines, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, drug toxicity)**
4.  **BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS** (should be used BEFORE considering medication):

  - Environment: is their bedspace well-lit? Would they benefit from a
    side-room?

  - Close observation: may require 1:1 RMN or HCW ?risk of falls or
    wandering

  - Social interaction and reassurance: explain patient what has
    happened, and why are confused. Reassure them that they are safe.
    Allow familiar items from home around the bedside and friends and
    family to visit.

  - Frequent reorientation: Help them to know what time it is and where
    they are - a large clock and a written message about where they are
    can be helpful.

  - Correct sensory impairments: Making sure that someone has their
    glasses and hearing aids – and that they are working\!

  - Restore sleep/wake cycle: *Lights on during day; Window shades open
    during day; Prevent daytime napping; Lights off at night; Minimize
    night time sleep disruption; Optimize Nutrition and monitor bowels*

  - Physical Therapy: *Encourage ambulation; Get the patient out of the
    bed*

5.  **PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:** General Considerations-

<!-- end list -->

  - Should only be used for <span class="underline">acute management of
    agitation or severe psychosis</span>, where behavioural
    interventions fail. **USE ONE DRUG AT A TIME.**

  - Use lower doses of medications for elderly and those with
    pre-existing cognitive, renal or liver impairment and/or
    neurological disease.

  - ECG: Check QTc PRIOR to administering antipsychotic medications and
    renal/liver function to guide dosing.

  - Avoid high potency antipsychotics in elderly patients; Parkinson’s
    patients; Lewy Body Dementia (DLB); patients with history of EPS or
    NMS

  - Monitor for akathisia, EPS, other side-effects – review
    <span class="underline">regularly</span>

  - TITRATE according to response (*Start low (dose) and go slow
    (titrate)*)

  - **Consider :**

<!-- end list -->

  - **FIRSTLINE **

  - **1. <span class="underline">Haloperidol 0.5-1mg PO/IM up to
    QDS</span> (max. 4mg daily; peak effect 4-6hr (oral) or 20-40min
    (IM) ) adjusted according to response **

> ***- avoid in DLB/Parkinson’s/NMS/history of serious cardiac disease
> ***
> 
> ***- must have normal baseline ECG ***
> 
> ***-monitor for extrapyramidal and cardiac side-effects***

  - **2. <span class="underline">Olanzapine 2.5 – 5mg PO max BD</span>
    (20mg daily or 10mg in elderly)**

  - **SECONDLINE: Promethazine 25mg up to QDS (max 100mg daily) OR
    Quetiapine 12.5 - 50 up to QDS (max 200mg daily) OR Risperidone 0.25
    - 1 OD-QDS (max. 4mg daily).**

  - **<span class="underline">Benzodiazepines</span>**: use in patients
    with alcohol withdrawal; benzodiazepine withdrawal; catatonia;
    stimulant/hallucinogen intoxication; NMS; serotonin syndrome;
    Parkinson’s; DLB (otherwise best avoided and avoid long-acting
    benzos e.g. diazepam where possible); where antipsychotic
    contraindicated.

  - **<span class="underline">Lorazepam 0.25 - 1 QD to QID 4 mg
    PO/IM</span> ( Remember risk of respiratory depression in some cases
    – consider flumazenil PRN).**
