Rapid Tranquilisation Guidance
==============================

The aim of pharmacological management of agitation is calm the patient
not to sedate them. It should only be used when non-pharmacological
measures have been tried and if appropriate non-pharmacological measures
should continue reduce the level of sedation needed. Rapid
Tranquilisation should be used only when there is risk to self or others
or of damage.

1.  Behavioural steps

2.  Oral Medications

3.  IM Medications

4.  IV Medications

5.  Seek expert advice

Behavioural techniques
----------------------

-   Time outs, allowing time and space for patients to settle

-   Engagement with staff to allow patients to air their issues

-   Offering distraction for example music

-   While medications take time to kick in and produce a transient
    improvement behavioural techniques can work immediately to
    de-escalate the situation, they also build trust with the patient
    and work better over time!

Medications
-----------

-   General principle is oral is preferred over IM unless acute risk due
    to better safety for staff and patient.

-   **Optimise regular medications.** So RT isn't being relied on.

-   **Avoid mixing antipsychotics.** Due to increased risk of side
    effects.

-   **Check interactions for medications especially if you are
    unfamiliar with** **them** (interaction of Quetiapine with strong
    CYP3A4 inhibitors such as Clarithromycin can be fatal).

-   **Do not give IM Olanzapine within 2 hours of IM Benzodiazepines**
    due to risk of fata respiratory depression, particular concern given
    to those who may be under the influence of alcohol.

-   **Use lower doses in children, the elderly, those with pre-existing
    reduced cognitive functioning (e.g. dementia, intellectual
    disabilities) **

### Oral and IM medications

#### Sedatives

Preferred for most patients especially if they are already on a regular
antipsychotic

-   Lorazepam 1-2mg can be given up to 1 hourly up to 4mg per 24 hours
    (PO/IM)

-   Promethazine 25-50mg can be given up to 1 hourly up to 100mg per 24
    hours (PO/IM)

#### Antipsychotics

If the patient is not on regular antipsychotic

-   Olanzapine 10mg

-   Risperidone 1-2mg

-   Quetiapine 50-100mg

-   Haloperidol 5mg (can be combined with promethazine 25mg) -- **Last
    resort due to risk of arrhythmia and monitoring requirements**

### IV Medications

Intravenous sedatives have markedly higher risk of respiratory
depression and should only be used if risk of not managing agitation
acutely is significant.

Diazepam 10mg over a minimum of 2 minutes, this can be repeated in
5-10mins if inadequate response.

Should only be given if the risk of over sedation can be managed. Have
respiratory support available (e.g. BVM) and flumazenil to hand.

### Monitoring

The risks with pharmacological treatment can be separated into two
types; those primarily a result of sedation; and those unrelated to the
tranquilisation. Sedation risks are respiratory depression which can be
fatal, falls and paradoxical agitation. Other risks with antipsychotics
include arrhythmia (particularly torsade de point due to QTc
prolongation), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, parkinsonianism and
oculogyric crisis.

-   Temperature

-   Pulse

-   Blood Pressure

-   Respiratory rate

Monitor the above every 15 minutes for 1 hour until the patient I
ambulatory. If not possible (due to refusal or contraindicated due to
patient behaviour) observe for signs of pyrexia, hypoxia, hypotension,
over sedation and general wellbeing.

**ECGs are required for any patient on Haloperidol**, and recommended
for every antipsychotic particularly at higher doses.
